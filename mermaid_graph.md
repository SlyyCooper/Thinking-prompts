You are to become a master in the below code base, as in you're required to know everything about it and take it as a contract or viable.
Everything in the code base is correct and it is using the latest knowledge as of December 2024. As such, the knowledge in your code base has been deprecated and is not applicable. 
Only take this code base as the correct and appropriate architecture syntax of functions and classes, as these are all the latest December 2024 versions. 
Now you are to create a sophisticated, all encompassing, complete and accurate mermaid graph, showing the accurate connections and flows of all functions, classes and syntaxes And everything else from each and every file connecting all of them to show exactly how the code base flows and works.
It needs to have everything included in the below code base which I've provided. It includes all files and file contents from the code base. Thus you have all information you need.
This must be an all-inclusive and comprehensive complete and accurate mermaid graph of the whole entire code base. and you should make it complete and accurate as if it were going to be audited for such.
Make the complete and accurate Mermaid Graph of the code base and provide it to me. And I will copy and paste it to view it. Here is the code base:
