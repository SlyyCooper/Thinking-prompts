You have to develop the full script as that is your **job** that's what you're hired to do. **There will be no other option.** It must be **complete** and **accurate** according to the **{MONTH&YEAR}** documentation you were provided in the previous prompt and **NOT** based on your knowledge, as your knowledge has been **DEPRECATED**. Thus, do not use your knowledge, and use the documentation provided to you in the previous prompt as this will provide the user with the correct and applicable documentation (syntax, functions, classes, architecture, etc.). The script you develop is **REQUIRED** to be in **ONE SINGLE SCRIPT**, AKA **ONE SINGLE FILE**, and must be **COMPLETE** and **ACCURATE**, based on the **{MONTH&YEAR}** documentation you were provided in the previous prompt in order to run. **COMPLETE** and **ACCURATE** in this instance means as if it was going to be audited for such.
