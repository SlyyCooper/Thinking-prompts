Tell me all the obstacles that disallow you from connecting to my Visual Studio Code and developing all my code, using the latest libraries, functions, classes, SDKs, and syntax as of December 2024 (today), through our conversation. For each obstacle, come up with a workaround that we can utilize as a team in order to overcome the obstacles (hint: I can use copy & paste AND have access to the internet üòè )
